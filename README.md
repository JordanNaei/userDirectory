# Employee Directory

This project goal was to create a employee directory with React by breaking the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to the following User events:

1- Serach an employee by First Name.
2- Reload all employees list after search is conducted.
3- Sort listed employees alphabatically using the first name as a reference and checkbox within the UI.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Features

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user will be able to:

  * Sort the table by the First Name. (Pass)

  * Filter the users by First Name. (Pass)
